1. Looking at the monitor for a long time
Due to the nature of his activity, a programmer must look at the monitor at least 8 hours a day. And not just look, but perform precise visual work. And this is on a luminous screen, with flickering images, differences in brightness, varying clarity and not always optimal illumination of the workplace. The visual analyzer works hard at all levels: sensory (retina), muscular (eye muscles), central (brain). As a result, there is a tendency to develop myopia, vision decreases, and dry eye syndrome develops. The intense work of the visual system is also associated with the appearance of headaches, sleep disturbances, increased fatigue, and increased stress. Doctors even identify such a concept as “computer vision syndrome.
2. Monotonous, monotonous small hand movements
When working at a computer, a programmer actively works with the mouse and fingers on the keyboard. In this case, the forearms are always located in the same plane, and the shoulders are fixed and constrained. The human body is not adapted to such monotonous long-term work. Therefore, after some time, the programmer develops glenohumeral osteoarthritis and “tunnel” syndrome. The hand with which the programmer operates the mouse suffers the most. For right-handed people it is the right hand, and for left-handed people it is the left hand. If measures are not taken in time, the disease will progress and can lead to complete loss of ability to work - disability.
3. Prolonged stay in a forced sitting position.
No matter how comfortable the programmer’s chair is, it is impossible to sit in one position, even the correct one, throughout the entire working day. Therefore, the programmer slouches, raises his shoulders, and bends. The muscles of the back and neck are in static tension for a long time. Other muscles of the body remain underused and weaken. As a result, the muscle corset cannot hold the body in a normal position. All this leads to the development of spinal curvatures and osteochondrosis. The situation is aggravated by an incorrectly positioned monitor. After all, you constantly need to lean towards him, arching your neck and back into an even more unnatural position.
4. Lack of sufficient physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle
Sitting at a computer all day, a programmer moves little. But the human body is not designed for a sedentary lifestyle. This complex engineering design of nature is designed for active movement. Remember primitive man. To simply eat, he had to find and kill a mammoth, drag it to the cave house, skin it, and butcher it. If you didn’t want to eat the mammoth raw, you had to run into the forest for firewood, make a fire, and place a piece of meat over the fire. And all these manipulations did not guarantee the appearance of a tender and soft gastronomic dish. Could our programmer do this for at least one day?
A programmer very quickly gets used to a sedentary lifestyle. After all, the less he moves, the less he wants to move. Fatigue, lethargy, an absolute reluctance to exert yourself, and universal laziness appear. An IT specialist travels from home to work and back by car, does not go shopping, buys goods in online stores with delivery, does not go to events, preferring to communicate with friends via Skype.
From insufficient load, the programmer’s body becomes decrepit, muscles weaken, blood vessels lose their elasticity, and metabolic processes are disrupted. An insufficient amount of oxygen reaches the body tissues due to deteriorated blood supply. Oxygen starvation of organs and tissues leads to the development of various chronic diseases. First of all, diseases of the cardiovascular system. Atherosclerosis, arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, varicose veins of the saphenous veins of the legs, and obesity appear. The risk of developing myocardial infarction and cerebral stroke increases significantly.
5. Smoking
A lot of programmers smoke. A cup of hot aromatic coffee and a cigarette is the height of bliss for most programmers. This “cocktail” makes you feel tired and sleepy. And why all? But because the nicotine contained in tobacco causes a narrowing of blood vessels. Because of this, the pressure in the bloodstream increases, which leads to increased blood supply to the brain. This immediately makes your head light up. Caffeine affects blood vessels in a similar way, enhancing the effect of nicotine. But the narrowing of blood vessels inevitably causes an increase in blood pressure levels. Doctors have proven that after one cigarette, a smoker’s blood pressure increases by 10 - 30 mmHg. Art.
The most dangerous thing for a programmer is smoking while working at the computer. After all, a person does not notice the number of cigarettes smoked. It gets to the point that before the smoked cigarette has gone out, the smoker lights the next one. In a room where at least one smoking programmer works, the smoke is thick. This is harmful not only for the smoker himself, but also for the people around him, especially children.
6. Lack of daily routine
No matter how trivial it may sound, your daily routine matters. Since our time at school, we know that we need to follow a daily routine, but most stubbornly ignore it. And in vain. Let's remember Pavlov's famous dog with its conditioned food reflexes. After all, our life is also largely built on conditioned reflex reactions. If a person eats at the same time, then by this time he begins to feel hungry, saliva and digestive juices are produced. To experience this for yourself, remember how you felt at lunchtime when you forgot to take your “stuff” with you to work. Remember how terribly you wanted to eat, your stomach was rumbling, you were “sucking in the pit of your stomach,” and your thoughts were only about food. Same with sleep.
Therefore, failure to adhere to the daily routine leads to digestive disorders, poor sleep and insomnia, increased fatigue, and low stress resistance.
7. Overtime and tension
If a programmer is a mediocre specialist, then he spends working hours in a small office and goes home on time, completely unencumbered by work problems. After all, he knows little and he has no reason to stay late after work. If a programmer is a good specialist, then he tries to do his work with the highest quality and on time, strives to complete all tasks, and find optimal ways to solve problems. The programmer's brain is constantly loaded. He thinks about code even when he is not sitting at the computer. Such a specialist becomes in demand in every way, which inevitably leads to involvement in non-core activities and overload. Fatigue is growing. It becomes chronic. The programmer falls asleep tired and wakes up tired too.
8. Lack of sleep
Our programmer likes to stay at the computer until late. After all, it works so well late in the evening: everyone is asleep, no one calls, no one distracts with conversations. And in the morning I have to go to work. Even with a free visiting schedule, which exists in many IT companies, you need to spend eight hours at work. Lack of sleep appears. At first it is not noticeable. But over time it accumulates like a snowball. When a person begins to regularly sleep less than 5 hours a day, his risk of developing chronic diseases, and especially hypertension, increases significantly.
9. Poor nutrition
The previous article already talked about the programmer’s passion for sausages, sausages, chips, and fast food with home delivery. This is a very high-calorie and fatty food. Yes. It tastes good, aromatic and ready for immediate consumption. But it is also very harmful. But was the programmer really interested in the product ingredients written in small print on the packaging?
Excessive consumption of fatty foods leads to increased cholesterol levels in the blood, the appearance of fatty plaques on the walls of blood vessels and the development of atherosclerosis. At the same time, the vessels become less elastic. Atherosclerotic plaques narrow the lumen of blood vessels. Blood flows through such vessels with great difficulty. All these processes lead to increased blood pressure levels.
On the other hand, a programmer’s diet is also not rational. After all, he never eats porridge and very rarely consumes soups. Vegetables are also not frequent guests on his table. Often he does not have breakfast, content with a cup of coffee, and likes to gorge himself at night. All this inevitably leads to overeating, excess weight, and gastrointestinal diseases.
10. Lack of meaningful communication
A programmer spends a huge part of his time in the company of a computer, deeply immersed in virtual reality. As a result, a person is separated from social life and desocialization develops. The programmer begins to be interested in his own personality less and less. After all, he is engrossed in his computer codes and projects. The programmer becomes depersonalized. Failures in writing programs, project failures, identification of major bugs and the need for rework can lead to the development of depression in a programmer.
11. Infections
A programmer spends a lot of time in an office where several computers work. The windows in the room rarely open. After all, there is always someone who is afraid of drafts. No one is happy with regular ventilation of the premises where employees leave. In winter, the central heating is turned on, and the air in the room becomes extremely dry. If a person with a respiratory infection enters such a microclimate, it immediately spreads to all employees. And if the office has air conditioning, then none of the employees are protected from Legionnaires' disease.
12. Dust
Which programmer wipes the dust off his desk? And on the system unit? And on the back surface of the monitor? And sometimes you can sign on the monitor screen itself. But dust accumulates on equipment even in clean, well-ventilated rooms. What can we say about poorly ventilated offices of IT specialists? Dust deposits contribute to the occurrence of allergic rhinitis. In people with existing allergic diseases, exacerbations of these diseases are caused.
It's not a very pleasant picture, is it? There are dangers lurking on all sides for the poor programmer. His entire lifestyle turned out to be unhealthy.
